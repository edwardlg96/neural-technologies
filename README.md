# Neutal Technologies Test Code

This repository contains the front-end test source code.

# Why only the front-end?

Because a requirement requested by the company i'm currently working at, I had to work some extra hours since friday until today at 4pm so I didn't had a considerable amount of time to develop all the requirements for this test... I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

### Running the attached code

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the `cd` command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run `npm install` to install all required dependencies (this will create a `/node_modules` folder). Then start the project by running `npm start`.
